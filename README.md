# RFidReaderCalTech

## Getting Started

Welcome to Mice-Detector. The goal of this project is to allow mice to enter and exit testing chambers without human help. The mice will travel through a tube with 2 RFid sensors on each end. The mice will also have a RFid chip implemented in their head so they can be read. 

### Prerequisites

Hardware: 2 arduino unos, 2 Tower Pro SG-5010 servos, 2 ONETAK 125kHZ RFid Readers, linux machine

Libraries: pyUSB, pyTransitions, keyboard_alike
